# Job
Before using **kubectl**, please set the **KUBECONFIG** environment variable to point to the right kubeconfig file.

```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=../02-Multi-node_cluster/vagrant/kubeconfig.yaml
```

A job in Kubernetes is a supervisor for pods carrying out batch processes, that is, a process that runs for a certain time to completion, for example a calculation or a backup operation.

Letâ€™s create a job called countdown that supervises a pod counting from 9 down to 1:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f job.yaml
job.batch/countdown created
```

You can see the job and the pod  like so:

```console
$ kubectl get jobs
NAME        COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
countdown   1/1           2s         2s
```


```console
$ kubectl get pods
NAME              READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
countdown-xjmhc   0/1     Completed   0          75s
```

To learn more about the status of the job, do:

```console
$ kubectl describe jobs/countdown

  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  2m51s  job-controller  Created pod: countdown-xjmhc
```

And to see the output of the job via the pod it supervised, execute:

```console
$ kubectl logs countdown-xjmhc
9
8
7

5
4

2
1
```

To clean up, use the delete verb on the job object which will remove all the supervised pods:

```console
$ kubectl delete jobs/countdown
job.batch "countdown" deleted
```
